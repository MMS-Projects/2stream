2STREAM
=======

2STREAM is a application that allows you to live stream video. It is still in alpha but please don't hesitate to test it.

You can find our Jenkins Build-Bot job over [here](http://jenkins.marlinc.nl/job/2STREAM/).
We don't have a Travis-CI test-set yet but this may come in the future.
